# A Poll Aggregator for the 2022 French Presidential Election

(just for fun‚Äîwork in progress)

## Data

I use data from all voting intention polls fielded since September 1, 2021, based on the survey reports available on the [Commission des sondages website](https://www.commission-des-sondages.fr/notices/). Up to now, I have kept data from all scenarios testing one of the three main Les R√©publicains candidates‚ÄîXavier Bertrand, Val√©rie P√©cresse, and Michel Barnier‚Äìand average them; I will adjust in early December, when we know who will eventually be the candidate for Les R√©publicains. I have also kept scenarios both including and excluding √âric Zemmour (see Model for more details).

## Model

I build on [Heidemanns, Gelman and Morris (2020)](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/nw1dzd02/release/1) to build a poll aggregator that does just that‚Äîaggregating polls‚Äîwith no prediction intention whatsoever. The model is estimated with Stan.

For each scenario _i_ (part of poll _p_ = _p[i]_) and each candidate _c_, _y<sub>ci</sub>_ is the number of respondents who indicated support for candidate _c_, and _n<sub>i</sub>_ is the total number of respondents supporting any of the candidates tested in scenario _i_. I fit a binomial model:

where ùúΩ<sub>_ci_</sub> is modeled as

### Splines

I model the evolutions of voting intentions over time with a spline of degree 3 with _K_ = 4 knots (as of today):

where (_B<sub>3k</sub>_(.))<sub>_k_</sub> is a sequence of _B_-splines. I define a poll's date as the median day of the fielding period, or as the day immediately following the median when that median is not properly defined. To enforce smoothness and prevent the model from overfitting, I impose a random-walk prior on (ùõº<sub>_ck_</sub>)<sub>_ck_</sub>:

### Poll and Organization Effects

In order to partially pool information among the various scenarios of the same poll, I include a candidate-specific poll effect ùúá<sub>_cp[i]_</sub>, and I also adjust for polling organization effects (ùúÜ<sub>_co[i]_</sub>). Both are given a hierarchical structure and estimated with weakly informative priors:

### Other Covariates

The vector _X<sub>i</sub>_ includes log(_n<sub>i</sub>_) to adjust for a potential sample size effect, two (standardized) dummies that adjust for the subsample of respondents that the polling organization calculated their estimates on (all respondents, only respondents who are absolutely sure that they will vote in April 2022, or an intermediary subsample), and a dummy that flags whether √âric Zemmour was among the tested candidates.

I include the Zemmour dummy because not all polls included scenarios that tested √âric Zemmour as candidate in early September. Keeping only scenarios that included Zemmour‚Äîand thus completely discarding polls that did not include a Zemmour scenario‚Äîwould make the September estimates very noisy, and it would be a waste of information. Yet it remains that scenarios without Zemmour are not very informative per se, as he will very likely be candidate, and his inclusion among the candidates significantly changes voting intentions for other candidates (especially Marine Le Pen and the candidate from Les R√©publicains). The current specification leverages polls that included scenarios both with and without Zemmour to estimate the impact of not including him on the voting intentions for other candidates, and allows me to adjust the results from from that did not include Zemmour scenarios.
